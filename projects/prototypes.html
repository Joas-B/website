                            This was a solo project, and as such I created and put together every element of the game, with the exception of the creation of the audio assets.

                                    Designed, programmed and iterated on the "rhythmic" walking mechanic that enhances the sense of physical exploration.

                                    Designed the level, and modelled and implemented the environment.

                            <b>About the Project</b>
                            <br>
                            This was my Honours project for university, meaning I spent most of a school year working on the design, proposal, development, and a dissertation.
                            <br>
                            The focus of the game was to recreate the experience of walking a pilgrimage. The primary was a unique, rhytmic walking mechanic that made players more immersed in the experience, and felt more physical. 
                            I create a large, stylistic environment that immerses players in the atmosphere as they explore it. To add on to this, I included several characters also on a pilgrimage, who all have their own perspective and experience with it. 
                            This created a sense of introspection and human connection, which would make players consider their own perspective in it.
                            <br>
                            As such, the final result was a meditative, relaxing, atmospheric, and introspective experience for players, and I received very positive feedback on the game.
