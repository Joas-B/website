                                <li>
                                    Worked together with other team members to design the concept, mechanics, story, and overall the basis of what the project would be.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Prototyped the level design and some of the mechanics.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Created two full levels, one of which was introductory. This included initial planning and designs, creating the layout, adding gameplay elements, iterating, and creating camera systems to correctly follow the player.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Helped with programming in terms of implementing mechanics, implementing levels, and debugging.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Lead the quality assurance on the project by preparing playtest forms, communicating with playtesters, compiling their results, and tracking the issues that the team needed to fix.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Was in charge of creating builds of the project, and overseeing the source control.

                            <br>
                            Hotaru is a prototype of a charming action-adventure game, where the player takes control of Mush, and goes on a quest to find out why all the light has disappeared from the world, to save the fireflies, and bring back the light.
                            <br>
                            It's a game that focuses on being a relaxing adventure with easy yet fun gameplay, and an evocative world to explore and engaging story to follow.
