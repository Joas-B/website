                            <b>About the Project</b>
                            <br>
                            Purgatory was a game created for a university module where I could create a project of my own specification.
                            <br>
                            This project was mostly focused on creating a sense of space and environment, where the player can soak in the atmosphere. 
                            The spaces were influenced by the works of Giorgio de Chirico, Gerard Trignac, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, and the architectural work in the games by Fumito Ueda and Team Ico.
                            My time limit was fairly short, and I really pushed myself into more visual territory for this project. 
                            I think improvements could be made with more time and the skills I have now to create 3D assets better and quicker, but I think it's still a nice little experience, and am happy with the result and what I learned.
                            <br>
                            This was also an entirely solo project where I had to manage all aspects of seeing a project through to the end by myself.
