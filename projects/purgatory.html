                            <br>
                            Purgatory was a game created for a university module where I could create a project of my own specification.
                            <br>
                            I chose to create a small atmospheric, interactive experience set in a strange and barren landscape inspired by the works of Gerard Trignac, and architectural spaces of Fumito Ueda and Team Ico.
                            Throughout this process I handled every aspect of development. It was largely a good learning experience for working under tight deadlines as my other classes during that term took up the majority of my time, and additionally, the project taught me what methods are effective for creating atmospheric environments.
