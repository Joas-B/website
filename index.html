                        I'm <b>Joas</b>, and my little portfolio website showcases who I am, <a href="projects/index.html">my game development projects</a>, and <a href="other.html">other stuff</a> I've worked on. 
                        This website is a bit in progress - I'm hoping to add more stuff!

                        <b>About Me:</b><br>
                        I'm Joas Bremer, and I like games, literature and art, and have studied and worked within these creative fields. I grew up internationally in the Netherlands, Alaska, Norway and now Scotland, where I currently live with my amazing partner.
                        <br><br>
                        Growing up I loved boardgames and video games, and would design and develop my own starting at age 6. 
                        Since then I've studied Game Design and Production at Abertay University, and literature at the Open University. 
                        I have grown particularly interested in studying games and literature in combination, and have been developing more 'artsy' games that take influences from both mediums.
                        Eventually I hope to further my academic journey, but for now I will continue working on these types of games and will try studying and writing about this subject.

                        <b>Other:</b><br>
                        My main hobby is games (you can see what I'm playing <a href="https://www.backloggd.com/u/Joas/">here</a>), including playing boardgames and TTRPGs with family and friends. 
                        I also love literature, and enjoy reading classics, am challenging myself to read a book from every country, and run an online book club. 
                        Other interests include hiking and cycling, caring for plants, and recently, trying out knitting and more complex cooking.
                        <br><br>
                        Generally I'd say my interests are to explore the variety of what's out there.
                        There's simply too many wonderful, beautiful and cool things out there to not explore it and contribute what I can in return.
